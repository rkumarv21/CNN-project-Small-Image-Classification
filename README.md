# CNN-project-Small-Image-Classification
I have used a tensorflow dataset which is cifar10. Firstly used artificial neural network model to predict the image object but it it is giving very poor accuracy. Then I used Convolution neural network classifier to predict the image object and this CNN model is giving up to acceptable level of accuracy.
